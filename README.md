# Data Warehousing Demo

Our group focused on the Couchbase Database

## Install and Setup

This is based on a linux system as we decided our demo would be ran Zach Buckley's laptop (running Ubuntu 18.04.01 LTS)

### Docker Installation and Setup

```bash
sudo apt install docker
sudo usermod -aG docker zbuckley
```

*A restart will be necessary after the usermod comand is ran*

### Container Management

This section describes the process of starting and managing the container on your
local system.

#### Downloading/Creating/Starting Docker Container

```bash
docker run -d --name db -p 8091-8094:8091-8094 -p 11210:11210 couchbase:community
```

Or, use the convenient script provided:

```bash
./docker_image_start
```

#### Stopping the Docker container

```bash
docker stop db
```

Or, use the convenient script provided:

```bash
./docker_image_stop
```

#### Delete the Docker container

*NOTE: Deleting the container, also deletes data and configuration settings*

```bash
docker rm db
```

Or, use the convenient script provided:

```bash
./docker_image_delete
```

#### Restart the Docker Container

*Note: This assumes you've created the container, and stopped it.*

```bash
docker start db
```

Or, use the convenient script provided:

```bash
./docker_image_restart
```

## Cluster Setup

1. Open a web browser to the following address: `http://localhost:8091`
2. Startup screen should say `Couchbase Server`, and `Community Edition 6.0.0 build 1693`. The exact build number shouldn't really matter that much.
3. Select `Setup New Cluster`
4. Enter Cluster Name: `rocinante`
5. Change Admin Username: `jholden`
6. Set the password: `miller`
7. Select `Next: Accept Terms`
8. Accept the Terms
9. Select `Finish With Defaults`

## Sample Bucket

1. Open a web browser to the following address `http://localhost:8091`
2. Select `Settings` either on the left, or from top-right menu
3. Select `Sample Buckets` Tab
4. Select `travel-sample`
5. Select `Load Sample Data`

### Bucket Management Exploration

1. From the main menu, select `Buckets`
2. Select `travel-sample` Bucket, by clicking on the bucket Name
3. See:

  * Number of Items
  * Memory Usage
  * Disk Usage

4. Select Statistics from the right side:
5. See:

  * Lots of stats for helping to diagnose issues/monitor usage levels

### Queries (N1QL, SQL-like)

Complete Reference for [N1QL Query Language](https://docs.couchbase.com/server/4.0/n1ql/n1ql-language-reference/index.html).

1. From the main menu, select `Query` to open the `Query Editor`
2. Experiment with the sample Queries below:

#### CRUD Operations

Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations covered in this section:

As a *Read* operation, lets view the first 10 records in travel sample.
*NOTE: throughout the N1QL queries we'll need to use back-ticks in order refer to travel-sample*

```SQL
SELECT * FROM `travel-sample` LIMIT 10;
```

You can view the results in different formats, by selecting a different tab
in the results area of the editor. Select `Table` for example.

Lots of airlines... As another *Read* operation, lets see if there are other types:

```SQL
SELECT * FROM `travel-sample` WHERE type != 'airline' LIMIT 10;
```

Interesting.. Can we get a list of all the different types (*Read* Operation)?

```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT type FROM `travel-sample`;
```

How many airlines are in our bucket (*Read* Operation)?

```SQL
SELECT COUNT(name) FROM `travel-sample` WHERE type == 'airline';
```

Let's look for an airline to delete (*Read* Operation).
*NOTE: META().id to show the primary key for the documents*

```SQL
SELECT name, id, META().id as document_key FROM `travel-sample` WHERE type == 'airline';
```

Let's go for... Locair. First, here's a query by primary key for the airline document (*Read* Operation)

```SQL
SELECT * FROM default WHERE META().id = "airline_10748";
```

Ok, our first *Delete* operation, let's delete Locair airline.
We'll use the `RETURNING` clause to get back the contents of the airline document,
and it's primary key, as we delete it.

```SQL
DELETE FROM `travel-sample` WHERE type == 'airline' AND name == 'Locair' RETURNING *, META().id as document_key;
```

Using the primary Key query above, lets verify that the document is no longer in no longer in the database.
NOTE: While the query below does work, according to the [N1QL Docs](https://docs.couchbase.com/server/4.1/developer-guide/retrieving.html), it is typically recommended to use the key-value api when the key is known

```SQL
SELECT * FROM `travel-sample` WHERE META().id = "airline_10748";
```

As our first *Create* Operation, let's see how we would put Locair's airline record back into the database:
*NOTE: To restore the document, and maintain relationships between this document and others, we need to
ensure that the key we insert the document under, comes from the deletion output above.*

```SQL
INSERT INTO `travel-sample` (KEY, VALUE)
VALUES(
    "airline_10748",
    {  "callsign": "LOCAIR",
      "country": "United States",
      "iata": "ZQ",
      "icao": "LOC",
      "id": 10748,
      "name": "Locair",
      "type": "airline"
    }
) RETURNING META().id as document_key, *;
```

Let's check that Locair is back in the system (*Read* Operation):

```SQL
SELECT * FROM `travel-sample` WHERE META().id = "airline_10748";
```

Now, as our first *Update* operation, lets update LOCAIR's country, by replacing the whole document:

```SQL
UPSERT INTO `travel-sample` (KEY, VALUE)
VALUES(
    "airline_10748",
    {  "callsign": "LOCAIR",
      "country": "Australia",
      "iata": "ZQ",
      "icao": "LOC",
      "id": 10748,
      "name": "Locair",
      "type": "airline"
    }
) RETURNING META().id as document_key, *;
```

Let's check that the update occurred (*Read* Operation):

```SQL
SELECT * FROM `travel-sample` WHERE META().id = "airline_10748";
```

Now, we'll change all airlines with country = Australia to AU... but lets do that,
without replacing all the documents. Instead our *Update* operation should only change
the value we care about in each document:

```SQL
UPDATE `travel-sample`
SET country = "AU"
WHERE type = "airline"
AND country = "Australia"
RETURNING META().id as document_key, *;
```

We can see from the return information, that Locair was updated... and appears to have
been the only document where `country = 'AU'`. For completeness, Let's check that
using our *Read* operation from above, shows Locair being updated.

```SQL
SELECT * FROM `travel-sample` WHERE META().id = "airline_10748";
```

Highly recommend reviewing stats and metrics to see the effect of the operations above,
on the database performance. The metrics and monitoring available out of the box (so to speak),
are great tools.
